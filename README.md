- [ ] Recursive descent parser for regular expressions
- [ ] building nfas, and dfas
- [ ] converting from nfa -> dfa
- [ ] converting from regex -> nfa
- [ ] minimizing dfas

## Questions

- How to best test the parser?
- Feedback: How to improve it?
- Why might have `Maybe` been useful?
- How to disallow inputs like `??`, and `**`?
- How to overwrite the implementation of `show` for Data.Set?
